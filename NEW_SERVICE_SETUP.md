# 🔄 New Service Created: heartfelt-integrity

## 📊 Current Situation

The old service **"remarkable-reprieve"** was deleted, and Railway has created a new service called **"heartfelt-integrity"**.

### Status:
- ✅ **Redis**: Running (1 hour ago via Docker Image)
- ✅ **Postgres**: Running (1 hour ago via Docker Image)
- ⏳ **heartfelt-integrity**: Queued (waiting for build slot)

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Environment Variables Need to be Set Again!

The new service **does NOT have the environment variables** that were set for the old service. You need to set them again!

---

## 🚀 Quick Fix - Set Variables in Railway Dashboard

### Option 1: Using Dashboard (Recommended - Fastest)

1. **Go to the new service**:
   - Click on "heartfelt-integrity" in the dashboard

2. **Go to Variables tab**

3. **Click "Raw Editor"**

4. **Paste these variables**:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
REDIS_URL=${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}
JWT_SECRET=I8E8MINMtxCvMsm//ViA0I6jy/qb0vpzA9mb7GKY4YuWtqBydRyQgeKkVGj6nBJP
IS_GENERAL=true
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
FRONTEND_URL=${{RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}}
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://${{RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}}/api
BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL=http://localhost:3000
STORAGE_PROVIDER=local
API_LIMIT=30
```

5. **Click "Save"**

6. **The deployment will continue automatically**

---

## 🔧 Option 2: Using Railway CLI

Since the service changed, you need to link to the new service first:

### Step 1: Unlink from old service
```bash
cd /Users/gene/Projects/Master-Social-Posting-V1
rm -rf .railway
```

### Step 2: Link to new service (Interactive)
```bash
railway link
# Select: postiz-master-social
# Select: production
# Select: heartfelt-integrity
```

### Step 3: Run the setup script
```bash
./setup-railway-env.sh
```

**OR manually set variables:**

```bash
railway variables --set "DATABASE_URL=\${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}"
railway variables --set "REDIS_URL=\${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}"
railway variables --set "JWT_SECRET=I8E8MINMtxCvMsm//ViA0I6jy/qb0vpzA9mb7GKY4YuWtqBydRyQgeKkVGj6nBJP"
railway variables --set "IS_GENERAL=true"
railway variables --set "NODE_ENV=production"
railway variables --set "PORT=5000"
railway variables --set "FRONTEND_URL=\${{RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}}"
railway variables --set "NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://\${{RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}}/api"
railway variables --set "BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL=http://localhost:3000"
railway variables --set "STORAGE_PROVIDER=local"
railway variables --set "API_LIMIT=30"
```

2. 🔨 Build starts (~11 minutes)
3. 📦 Deploy (~1 minute)
4. 🚀 Startup (~2-3 minutes)
   ✅ Prisma connects to DATABASE_URL
   ✅ Services start
5. ✅ Health check passes
6. ✅ Deployment successful!
```
